# Encryption--Project-2-
This project was just to create a simple website to encrypt and decrypt a string.

## Files

### `Encryptor.js`
This js file is for the encryption side of the website. Using a simple substitution cipher, it generates a random key and encrypts the string from the substitution cipher with elements of the key. Every method in this file contributes to the substitution cipher.

### `GUI.html`
The website portion is lcoated in this HTML file. It creates a simple website format to provide a typing box and a button to encrypt and decrypt a string along with a key. It then uses the <script> tag to run the `Encryptor.js` file to actually encrypt and decrypt the data which the website then displays.
